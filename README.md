# Social-Network-API

## Description üìù:

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The seed data is created using Insomnia.

## Features:

* GIVEN a social network API
* If I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
* If I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* If I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
* If I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user‚Äôs friend list.
